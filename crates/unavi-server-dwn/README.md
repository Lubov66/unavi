# unavi-server-dwn

UNAVI implementation of a self-hostable [Decentralized Web Node](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/) (DWN).

> Decentralized Web Nodes are a mesh-like datastore construction that enable an entity to operate multiple nodes that sync
> to the same state across one another, enabling the owning entity to secure, manage, and transact their data with others
> without reliance on location or provider-specific infrastructure, interfaces, or routing mechanisms.
